Group Members:
    Jamie Coker, Wyatt Bechtle & Chris Ennis (Milestone 1 PM)

Project idea:
    Loreweave - It's a community based story weaver where users create characters and stories. Stories are added to piece-by-piece by different players.

How it meets the requirements:
    User Authentication: Players login in and create character profiles
    User Profile: Each player has a profile showing their created character, active stories, story contributions, and earned "lore points." (Voting system for rating stories) Profiles will be editable by the player.
    Messaging: The addition of story turns and voting communication via lore points.
    Transactions: The transaction is the submission of a "story turn." Players take turns adding to the narrative, and these submissions are tracked. Lore point could also be seen as transactions.
    Database: Would require tables for Users, Characters, Stories, Story_Turns, Lore_Points_Ledger, and potentially other quests or achievements tied to lore points.

What tools are you using?
    Java Spring Boot - Maven - H2 Database - Oauth2(?)

What will be accomplished by the next meeting:
    Repo + DB design + Entities, JWT security config, Frontend scaffold + login UI

Show off what you have so far:
