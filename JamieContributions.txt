Milestone 1 Contributions:
Week 1: Updated pom.xml to target Java 17 and ensured compatibility with Spring Boot 3.

        Implemented JWT Security setup:

        Added SecurityConfig.java with stateless session handling and JWT filter.

        Created JwtAuthenticationFilter to validate tokens on requests.

        Built JwtService for token generation, validation, and username extraction.

        Added CustomUserDetailsService to load user credentials from the database.

        Configured BCryptPasswordEncoder for secure password hashing.

        Developed AuthController with /api/auth/login endpoint to authenticate users and return JWT tokens.

        Verified and updated User entity & UserRepository so authentication works with the DB.

        Configured application.properties:

        Set up H2 in-memory database for testing.

        Enabled Hibernate ddl-auto=create-drop for clean schema on each restart.

        Enabled /h2-console for debugging database content.

        Resolved merge conflicts in:

        application.properties (kept JWT + H2 config).

        pom.xml (merged in spring-security-test, Thymeleaf, and Actuator).

        Ensured the application now builds successfully and can run with JWT authentication enabled.
