For the first Milestone, I focused on the Frontend:

I started off researching frontend frameworks that work well with Spring Boot. After considering a 
few different options, I chose Thymeleaf. I spent a few days learning more about how to use Thymeleafâ€™s. 
Java template engine. Then I researched how to style the html, i.e., CSS files within a static resource 
or Bootstrap. I had yet to utilize Bootstrap, so I chose Bootstrap and began learning more about it. 
Once I knew how to do the basics, I completed the following tasks:

1) Integrated Thymeleaf into the Maven pom.xml
      a) Added two dependencies to allow for the use of Thymeleaf
2) Created the ContentController to handle HTTP requests
      a) Mapped login, register, and welcome pages
      b) Moved mapping from HomePageController to ContentController
3) Updated main method in LoreWeaveApplication 
      a) Change the Header to standard form
4) Created associated directories for Thymeleaf
      a) directories for html and static resources
      b) directory for Controller for HTTP request handling
5) Created a login page
      a) Utilized HTML and Bootstrap to make the login page with actionless forms (Next on To-Do)
      b) Linked the webpage to a registration page
6) Created a register page
      a) Utilized HTML and Bootstrap to make the registration page with actionless forms (Next on To-Do)
      b) Linked the webpage to a login page
7) Hosted Zoom Meeting for team
